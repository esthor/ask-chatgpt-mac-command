# ask-chatgpt-mac-command
A simple workaround until OpenAI lands on an API for developers to pass messages to ChatGPT's macos App ðŸ¤·

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Put this file in your Home directory (`~/`) or wherever you keep custom shell scripts
2. Open your `~/.zshrc` or other shell config file, add the following: `source ~/.unified-single-file-example.sh`
3. Restart your shell (or open a new window, or run source command pointing at your shell rc file...you do you, fam.)
4. Test that it works by trying to pass a non-existent pnpm command through npm, like `npm yallthisisneeato` and see what ChatGPT says

## REQUIREMENTS
macOS
ChatGPT mac app
zsh (other shells untested)
